# Making Resume App with flutter
Flutter is an open-source mobile SDK developer can use to build native-looking Android and iOS applications from the same code base. Here Dart language is used to develop flutter app.
Here is a simple project I worked on:
<h5>Resume App</h5>
A basic flutter app where I have put up my resume. It consists of a home page which is my profile page and then you can go to the next page where I have put up my resume. You can scroll down to know about the skills and projects I have been working on.
