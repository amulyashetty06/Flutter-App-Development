        The internship was on <em><strong>Mobile application development with flutter</strong></em>. I learnt about
        flutter
        software installation, environment setup followed by programming using basics and advanced concepts.
    </p>
    <p>
        I learnt about dart language, a language developed by Google to develop apps in Flutter. I learnt about the
        material
        designs which flutter uses to make attractive UI. I also learnt various functionalities that can be added to the
        app.
    </p>
    <p>
        I learnt how to make basic apps like profile app and Time and Weather app.
    </p>
    <p>
        During the 15 days offline period of internship I worked on two Apps.They are:
    </p>
    <p>
        1.Resume App: A basic flutter app where I have put up my resume. It consists of a home page which is my profile
        page and then you can go to the next page where I have put up my resume. You can scroll down to know about the
        skills and projects I have been working on.
    </p>
    <p>
        2.News App:A flutter app made with the help of NewsApi Org. Here the user can see all the top headlines in the
        homepage. User can scroll down to see more headlines. Also in this project various categories have been added
        where the user, on tapping a particular category, will be taken to another page where all the headlines
        belonging to that particular category will be displayed. The user can tap on any of the headlines which will
        take her/him to a specific website reporting this news. All the headlines being displayed is fetched by the app
        from the Api.
